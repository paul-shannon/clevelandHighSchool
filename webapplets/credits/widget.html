<center> <h4>Executive Summary</h4></center>

South Seattle's Duwamish Valley has long been referred to as a community with environmental
injustices - a community with disproportionately high environmental health burdens and risks
and fewer positive environmental benefits than the rest of Seattle—but limited evidence has been
available to date to validate or quantify this characterization. The Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition/
Technical Advisory Group (DRCC/TAG) received an Environmental Justice (EJ) Research grant
from EPA to conduct a Cumulative Health Impacts Analysis (CHIA) to document and quantify the
Duwamish Valley's environmental health status relative to other areas of Seattle. Cumulative impacts
are defined as: "any exposures, public health, or environmental effects from the combined emissions
and discharges, in a geographic area, including environmental pollution, from all sources, whether
single or multimedia, routinely, accidently, or otherwise released" (OEHHA, 2010).
In accordance with California EPA’s cumulative impacts ranking methodology, a total of 15 indicators
in five categories were selected and input into a formula to calculate cumulative heath impact scores
for ten representative Seattle ZIP codes. Indicators included socioeconomic factors; sensitive populations;
environmental exposures; environmental effects; and public health effects (OEHHA, 2010).
From an environmental exposures perspective, Beacon Hill/Georgetown/South Park (ZIP code 98108)
had the highest ranking for air pollution and for exposure to confirmed and suspected contaminated
sites. This area also had one of the highest rankings in the city for unhealthy environmental effects,
i.e., lack of access to a healthy built environment. Cumulatively, these poor environmental scores combined
with high ranks for social vulnerabilities (socioeconomic factors and sensitive populations) and
a medium ranking for public health effects resulted in the highest cumulative impact score of Seattle
ZIP codes in the study. The results of this cumulative analysis provide a firm basis for characterizing
the Duwamish Valley as an area with disproportionate health impacts and environmental injustices.
Additional evidence, including at the larger Duwamish watershed scale and at the smaller census tract
scale, reinforce these cumulative findings, and further suggests that the ZIP code level analysis may
obscure even greater disparities in the riverside communities of South Park and Georgetown. In
comparing residents of the Duwamish Valley to King County, Duwamish Valley residents are more
likely to live in poverty, be foreign born, have no health insurance or leisure time, and are more likely
to be sick. Georgetown and South Park residents have up to a 13-year shorter life expectancy (at birth)
than wealthier parts of Seattle.

In light of these cumulative findings, the Duwamish Valley merits attention from decision-makers regarding
health protective and proactive environmental regulations, policies, practices, and actions. The
results of this analysis will inform recommendations that DRCC/TAG will make to EPA, Washington
state, and local government agencies regarding the Lower Duwamish River Superfund Site. In addition,
DRCC/TAG will provide this report to federal, state, regional, and local governments; community-based
organizations; and other stakeholders and decision-makers, to help guide the development of
policies and actions to improve overall environmental health and equity in the Duwamish Valley.
